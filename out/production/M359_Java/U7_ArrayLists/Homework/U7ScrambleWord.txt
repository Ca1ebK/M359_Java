loop through every letter in the word except for the last
if a letter starts with "a" and is followed by a letter other than "a"
    add the second letter to the string to be returned
    ...then add the first letter to the string to be returned
    increment index by one so that we can skip over the next letter
else:
    add the letter
    if the index is at length - 2, add the last letter
---
loop through every letter in the word up to the last
temp variable for holding a swapped index
if a letter starts with "a" and is followed by a letter other than "a"


while an index is less than the length of the word
